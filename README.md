# VenusTheme 'Neon' ü§üüèºüåü

__Do you want a neon universe to be your computer theme?.__

Well, here is the VenusTheme for people who want to bring their desire out, a stand above the rest with a beautiful theme. 

Don't use near casino, so people don't get hooked by the neon look, Pss. Bring some Sunglasses.


This color scheme is based on my dreams between galaxy and coding.
So i bundled them together to make the greatest theme of all time! 


## Why name it VenusTheme?
Simply put. Venus is a beauty, so why not just call it what it is?


## Installation
To begin with, [install the base theme from the VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Anciaveus.venustheme). To enable the neon refer to the (Neon Installation) section.


### Warning
VS code doesn't natively support text effects and as a result, It's likely to be buggy and, whilst it looks rad, it isn't intended for extended use. VS Code doesn't support this type of text effects. Should something go wrong, like you can`t open VS Code then you can just fresh install of VS Code.


### Neon Installation

You will need have the __Custom CSS and JS extension__ to enable the neon. 
Before enabling Neon.

## Step 1. Set your active color theme to __VenusTheme__. 

## Step 2. Download the Custom CSS and JS extension [Link to Custom CSS and JS extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css). (Recommended to restart the vs code after installation of the plugin.)

## [Go to Settings.json {Beginner}] 
## Step 4. Down in left corner you see a wheel, click on it!. Then click on _Settings_ after that it should appear a new page with diffrent option click on extension to the left side in the row columm. Find the Custom CSS and JS extension then click on it. Now click on the settings.json button under the __Vscode_custom_css: ImportsCustom CSS/JS files, as an array of URLs, not file paths__ and paste in the line you see down below.

## [Go to Settings.json]
## Step 5. [If you did follow the beginner friendly step four then you dont need this step.) Go to __settings.json__ then copy this two line below and paste in your settings.

   ```json
    "vscode_custom_css.imports": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Acrenactive/VenusTheme/master/themes/venus.css"],
    "vscode_custom_css.policy": true,
   ```
 - [See here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme) for more details.

## Step 6. Open your command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Shift + ‚åò + P` and choose "__Enable Custom CSS and JS__". It will prompt you to restart, and after the restart you should have the lights on :)

## Step 7. if it appear a notification __Your Code installation appears to be corrupt. Please reinstall.__ dont worry just download
